**How to use this tool:**  
1. Upload a CSV file containing radiology reports (must include a 'report' column).  
2. Enter your OpenAI API key and model name (must be a JSON Schema-compatible OpenAI model, e.g., 'o4-mini', 'o3').  
3. Click **LLM Error Detection** to evaluate the reports for errors.  
4. After the evaluation, proceed to the labeling section below. Each report flagged with a potential error will be displayed for review.  
5. For each flagged report, select **True Error** or **False Positive** and click **Save & Next** to move on.  
6. Once all flagged reports are labeled, a summary is shown and the results are saved in the results directory.
